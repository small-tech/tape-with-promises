# Tape With Promises

## ðŸš¨ This package is depracated. ðŸš¨

[Tape version 5.x+](https://github.com/tape-testing/tape) supports promises (and thus async/await) and so this module is no longer necessary.

### If youâ€™re still on Tape version 4

Please consider upgrading to Tape 5.x.

If you canâ€™t right now, you can still install and use version 1.0.1 of this module:

```
npm install @small-tech/tape-with-promises@1.0.1
```

### To switch from this module to Tape version 5.x+:

1. Install tape:

    ```
    npm install tape
    ```

2. Remove this module:

    ```
    npm remove @small-tech/tape-with-promises
    ```

3. In your test files, import the tape instead of this module:

    ```
    // Replace:

    import test from '@small-tech/tape-with-promises'

    // With:

    import test from 'tape'
    ```

## About

Adds promise support ([`rejects()`](https://github.com/jprichardson/tape-promise#trejectspromise-expected-msg), [`doesNotReject()`](https://github.com/jprichardson/tape-promise#tdoesnotrejectpromise-expected-msg)) to [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) by decorating it using [tape-promise](https://github.com/jprichardson/tape-promise).

## Install

```
npm install --save-dev @small-tech/tape-with-promises
```

## Use

```js
import test from '@small-tech/tape-with-promises'

test('promises', async t => {
  await t.rejects(() => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // This does, indeed, reject.
        reject('Oh, no!')
      }, 100)
    })
  })
  await t.doesNotReject(() => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // This does, indeed, resolve.
        resolve('Yay!')
      })
    })
  })
})
```

If you save the above test in _tests/index.js_, you can run it with:

```shell
npx tape tests/**/*.js
```

Or, in your _package.json_ file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "tape tests/**/*.js"
  }
}
```

## Test

```shell
npm -s test
```
